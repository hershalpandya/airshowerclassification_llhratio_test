------llh_ratio_nd.py

Contains the main function to calculate log-likelihood ratio.

------llhr_main.py and llhr_class.py

class functions are called in the main file in a sequence to do operations.
just like i3tray.

pls note that llhr_main.py will not work out of the box. i deleted all extra statements from a working script to have a skeleton to show how to use llhr_class.py .

it is designed to perform like an i3tray on hdf5 files.

#MOST BASIC USE would go like this:

from llh_ratio_nd import *

llh_ratio = toz_sig = toz_bkg =0

for sub_hist_range in [hits_hist_range, unhits_hist_range, excluded_hist_range]:
    slice_vector = get_slice_vector(pdf_edges, sub_hist_range)

    sig_norm=np.sum(sig_pdf[slice_vector])
    bkg_norm=np.sum(bkg_pdf[slice_vector])

    temp = log_likelihood_ratio(heatmap1=sig_pdf[slice_vector],
                                 heatmap2=bkg_pdf[slice_vector],
                                 event_hist = event_hist[slice_vector])

    llh_ratio += temp[0]
    toz_sig += temp[1]
    toz_bkg += temp[2]
    # returns normalized heatmaps for each sub_hist_range
    # adding all into final_heatmap makes norm = 3.0
    # won't affect llh_ratio because it's a ratio
    # be careful if you start looking at llh
    final_heatmap_sig[slice_vector] = temp[3]*sig_norm/np.sum(temp[3]) 
    final_heatmap_bkg[slice_vector] = temp[4]*bkg_norm/np.sum(temp[4])
    llh_sig += temp[5]
    llh_bkg += temp[6]
