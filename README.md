**Description**:

The code was initially developed for the purpose of classifying air showers generated by different primaries using IceTop (Ref: https://pos.sissa.it/301/514) . 

I am generalizing the code presently so that it may be used by anyone to carry out a multi-dimensional PDF based log-likelihood ratio test. If you need to use this code, please feel free to contact me. And also cite the above ICRC'17 proceedings as a reference.
